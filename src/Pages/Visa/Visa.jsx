This means that you must believe that you are at risk of persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution in your home country. To make a claim, you can either present yourself at a Canadian port of entry or make a claim at an inland office. Once your claim is made, you will be given a hearing where you can present your case to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

This includes help with housing, food, and other basic necessities, as well as language training, employment assistance, and other services to help them integrate into Canadian society.

They may enter Canada by crossing the border between ports of entry or by using false documents. Irregular immigrants are also commonly referred to as "irregular border crossers" or "undocumented migrants".</strong></p>

                        <p className="mb-4"><strong>Irregular immigration is not the same as refugee claimants who enter Canada at a regular port of entry and make a claim for asylum or refugee protection. While refugee claimants are following the regular immigration process, irregular immigrants are not, and may face legal consequences for crossing the border irregularly.</strong></p>

                        <p className="mb-4"><strong>Canada has policies and procedures in place for dealing with irregular immigration, including the provision of temporary accommodation and access to legal, medical, and social services. However, the issue of irregular immigration can be controversial, and there is ongoing debate around how best to manage this issue while still upholding Canada's immigration laws and policies.</strong></p>
