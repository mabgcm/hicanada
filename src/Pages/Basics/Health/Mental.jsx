If you are experiencing mental health issues or emotional distress, it is important to seek help from a qualified healthcare professional.</strong></p>
            <p className='mb-4 text-left'><strong>In most provinces and territories, your family doctor is a good place to start if you are seeking mental health services. They can refer you to a specialist if needed or provide counseling themselves. Additionally, many communities have mental health clinics or organizations that provide counseling, therapy, and support groups.</strong></p>
            <p className='mb-4 text-left'><strong>Some provinces and territories also offer mental health hotlines, which provide immediate support and advice in a crisis. <strong className='text-info'>These hotlines</strong>  are staffed by trained professionals who can provide guidance and assistance over the phone.</strong></p>
            <p className='mb-4 text-left'><strong>Mental health services may not be fully covered by provincial/territorial health insurance plans. Some services may require out-of-pocket expenses or private insurance coverage. It's best to check with your healthcare provider or insurance company for more information on coverage.</strong></p>
