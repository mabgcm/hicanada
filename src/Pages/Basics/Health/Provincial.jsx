                                    </div>
                                    <p class='d-flex align-items-start'>Canada's health insurance system is administered at the provincial and territorial levels. Each province and territory has its own health insurance plan, often referred to as a provincial health card. These plans cover necessary medical services, including doctor visits, hospital care, and some diagnostic tests.</p>

                                    <div class="d-flex align-items-center mt-4">
                                        <GiCheckMark style={iconstyle} />
                                        <h4>Universal Coverage</h4>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>One of the key principles of Canada's health insurance system is universal coverage. This means that all Canadian residents, including newcomers and immigrants with permanent residency or certain visa statuses, are eligible for health insurance coverage. Universal coverage ensures that everyone has access to necessary healthcare services without financial barriers.</p>

                                    <p>Eligibility for health insurance coverage varies slightly between provinces and territories. Generally, newcomers are required to fulfill certain residency requirements, such as establishing their primary residence in a province or territory and having a valid immigration status. It's important to check the specific eligibility criteria of the province or territory where you reside.</p>
